## Jot Pad

Jot Pad is a quick weekend (week day? Idk, what day is it again?) hack to learn about [Operational Transformations](operational-transformation.github.io). I've been reading about OT a lot, and figured the best way to understand is to build. Jot Pad (for the lack of a better name) uses [QuillJS](https://quilljs.com) and [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/). 

### To-do

- Build single player mode
- Compose socket events
- Build a queue of deltas server-side
- Emit transactions via Socket IO
- Apply transformations via Quill
